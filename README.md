# PHP Prelude
*Prelude*

Whatever you decide to create, it is that which we consider *more*
*important*.

PHP Prelude is born to force PHP meet functional programming concepts.
It intends to be the minimal core features needed for a sane functional
environment (so no, not as minimal as defining SKI).

It also includes a nice dispatching system which might remember you
of Lisp/Clojure.

We are also trying to make a simple to use type system, something along
the lines of Lisp also.

The project is under active development as it is being used for research
in a web framework development.
